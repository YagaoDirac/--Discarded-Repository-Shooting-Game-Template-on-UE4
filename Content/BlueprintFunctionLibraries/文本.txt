BFL 2D geometry for STG

keys:
<(Vector2D)
component-wise less than.
return true when all components are less.

Expand:
will change name into Expand 2D

V2 to Angle:
return value is within [0,360)

Point Between Parallel Lines:
2 parallel lines have the same direction. Pay attention to this.

Point Inside Non-axis Aligned Rect:
The 3 functions are in a series. They receive different parameters but do the same thing.

Segment Intersection(only bool):
I removed the part calculating the intersection point. If you don't need the actrually point coordinary, use this version to save some efficiency.

Same Sign, Different sign:
Both are not complex. Read it directly to get further understanding.

Cubic Equation:
OK, you guys don't see this function.
(coming soon)
